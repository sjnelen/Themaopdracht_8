# Introduction
Introduction of the research and introduction research questions

Ever heard of the game FIFA by EA? It is the most popular football game in the world
played by millions. So to get the correct trajectory for the ball is one of the most
important aspects of the game. If the trajectory is not realistic it wouldn't be as
good of a game as it is now. One of the ways to get the correct trajectory is calculating 
it using a model with different forces acting on the ball. Think of things like speed, 
the gravity and air resistance. With these forces the trajectory of all kind of things
can be calculated if the correct parameters are chosen. But not every object has the
same forces acting on them. So in this report the trajectory of a football is chosen
to look at and model.

## Goal
  - Describe Goal (not the educational goal but the research goal)
  - Describe how you reach the goal (e.g. make model and figures, use different setting)
  - formulate hypothesis
  
As you might have guessed the goal is to model the trajectory of a football that is 
kicked by someone. This is done by calculating the different forces at play on any 
given moment. The forces chosen to model are velocity, acceleration and the Magnus 
force. With these three the ball's position can be calculated for any given moment.
The formulas for these three will be explained further in the theory section. 
In the results a few different starting parameters will be used to showcase different
paths of the ball. The expectation is that this model will show a realistic path for a 
football.

## Theory

- Describe the model
- Picture of the model

To understand this model a little knowledge about basic physics can be useful, but 
here is a small explanation about the forces. So everywhere around you are different
forces at play. The most easy to understand is the air resistance experienced with
most outside activities like running, cycling and even walking. For example with 
running you have to use energy to move forward, this is translated to force by 
your muscles. While moving you push the air out of the way and to do so the force 
you generate must be higher than the air resistance. If it is windy outside it takes 
more energy to move the same distance because the air exerts a higher force on you.
So lets take a look at al the forces on a football. Air resistance is one of them
of course, but also gravity and the Magnus force. All the forces on the ball are
combined in different formulas. Velocity, Acceleration and a formula for the Magnus
force. These three are split in a X-, Y-, Z-axis to calculate the forces in a 3D
plane.

Give an explanation of the model with citations of source \cite{Soertaert10} (replace this with actual source)
and formula explanation

### Velocity

$$ V = \sqrt{velocity.x^2 + velocity.y^2 + velocity.z^2} $$
### Magnus Force

#### Lambda 
$$ \lambda.z <- \lambda * (\omega.y*V.x- \omega.x * V.y) * e^-\mu $$

$$ \lambda.x <- \lambda * (\omega.y*V.z- \omega.z * V.y) * e^-\mu$$
$$ \lambda.y <- \lambda * (\omega.y*V.z- \omega.z * V.x) * e^-\mu $$
#### Acceleration

$$ az = \frac{-k * V.z * V + \lambda.z - m * g}{m} $$

$$ ax = \frac{-k * V.x * V + \lambda.x }{m} $$

$$ ay = \frac{-k * V.y * V + \lambda.y}{m} $$
